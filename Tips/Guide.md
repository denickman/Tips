Just:
Purpose: Creates a publisher that emits a single value and then finishes.
Value Emission: Emits only one value and then completes.
Usage: Useful for creating a publisher from a single value or constant.
Example: Creating a publisher to emit a default value or constant.


CurrentValueSubject:
Purpose: A subject that holds and emits the most recent value to its subscribers.
Value Emission: Emits the current value to new subscribers and any subsequent updates.
Usage: Useful when you need to expose a property as a publisher and want subscribers to receive the current value immediately upon subscription.
Example: Exposing a property as a Combine publisher.


AnyPublisher:
Purpose: A type-erasing publisher that can wrap any publisher and hide its specific type.
Value Emission: Passes through values and completion from the wrapped publisher.
Usage: Useful when you need to hide the specific publisher type or when you want to create a generic API.
Example: Returning a publisher from a function without exposing its implementation details.


PassthroughSubject:
Purpose: A subject that can emit values to its subscribers.
Value Emission: Emits values sent to it via its send() method.
Usage: Useful for more dynamic publishing scenarios where you want to manually control when and what values are sent to subscribers.
Example: Creating a custom publisher that emits values based on user interactions or other events.


Differences:

Initial Value: Just emits a single predefined value and completes, while CurrentValueSubject holds and emits the most recent value it received.
Completeness: Just completes after emitting its value, whereas CurrentValueSubject and PassthroughSubject remain open-ended and can emit values indefinitely.
Type Erasure: Just and CurrentValueSubject have specific types, while AnyPublisher and PassthroughSubject can wrap any publisher type and hide its specifics.



Similarities:

Value Emission: All of these types can emit values to subscribers, although their mechanisms and behaviors may differ.
Subscription: Subscribers can receive values emitted by these types and react accordingly.
Publisher Protocol: They all conform to the Publisher protocol and can be used in Combine pipelines.
